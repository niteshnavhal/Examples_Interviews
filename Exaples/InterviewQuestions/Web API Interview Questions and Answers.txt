SQL Interview Questions BY ASP.NET Core.
==========================================
(Note for more Information Add this text After Question ::- explain in simple way that say with me for long and interviewer)
(Would you also like me to give you a 15-second version and a diagram you can imagine easily during the interview? )



1. What is the RESTful API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web service APIs that comply with REST principles are called RESTful APIs. You can define the RESTful APIs using:

A base URI - Unique resource identifier.
HTTP methods - GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE mapped with CRUD operations.
A media type for data - used to exchange the information using data formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML.
For more visit RESTful APIs.



2. What are ASP.NET Web APIs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET Web APIs - A platform to build secure RESTful APIs which can be accessed by a broad range of clients including browsers,
Daemon Apps, and mobiles devices. In ASP.NET, you can use the same framework to build web pages and services. For more visit ASP.NET Web APIs



3. How will you differentiate SOAP APIs from RESTful APIs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rest is Use http , SOAP USE all proptocals like http, ftp, smtp etc. REST APIs are stateless and lightweight. REST APIs are used for CRUD operations. REST APIs are used to create web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. REST APIs are easy to use and can be consumed by any client. REST APIs are not limited to a specific protocol and can be used with any protocol such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. 
REST APIs are not limited to a specific data format and can be used with any data format such as JSON, XML, etc.
REST APIs are lightweight as there is no built-in security and transaction compliance. Because of their lightweight REST APIs are good choices for mobile application development, 
IoT (Internet of Things) and serverless computing. SOAP APIs provide built-in security, error handling, and transaction compliance which makes them heavier as compared to REST APIs. And REST APIs are fast as no additional processing is required.
SOAP APIs work well in distributed environments whereas REST APIs are used for point-to-point communication. SOAP uses XML message format whereas REST APIs use JSON message format smaller than XML.

4. What are the methods supported by ASP.NET Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET Web API offers four main HTTP methods which can be mapped to CRUD operations.

GET is used to retrieve the resource at specified URI.
PUT is used to update a resource at specified URI and can create a new resource if the server allows the client to specify a new URI.
POST is used to create new resources.
DELETE performs deletion of a resource at specified URI.
PATCH also used to update a resource by specifying a set of instructions - means how the resource should be modified.




5. Describe ASP.NET Core Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web API is a framework that is used to develop REST APIs that can be consumed by any client. 
ASP.NET Core provides the ability to develop RESTful services also known as Web APIs. Web API uses the concept of controllers derived from the ControllerBase class to handle the requests.




6. Differentiate MVC and Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET MVC is a framework to develop web apps and APIs using MVC architecture.
When you are driving your API controller class from Controller base class then it adds the support for views but when you want to create Web APIs then derive your API controller class from ControllerBase class. 
So MVC is just a design pattern and ASP.NET Web API is a framework to build RESTful APIs.



7. Explain commonly used attributes in ASP.NET Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commonly used attributes are Route, Bind, HttpGet, Consumes, Produces etc. For more you can visit Attributes.




8. What behaviors does the ApiController attribute provide?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you apply ApiController attribute on a controller class in a web API application, It allows you to take the benefit of below opinionated, API-specific behaviors.
Attribute based routing requirement
Model validation errors can automatically trigger HTTP 400 responses
Binding source parameter inference - which includes the attributes such as [FromBody], [FromForm], [FromHeader], [FromQuery], [FromRoute] and [FromServices].
Multipart/form-data request inference
Problem details for error status codes
For more visit ApiController Attribute.




9. How to disable automatic HTTP 400 responses in Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can disable the automatic trigger of HTTP 400 responses by setting SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter to 'True' in Startup.ConfigureServices as below.


    services.AddControllers()
    .ConfigureApiBehaviorOptions(options =>
    {
    options.SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter = true;
    });




10. Explain the controller action return types that ASP.NET Core web API provides.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET Core Web API offers the following return types for controller action methods.
A Specific Type - An action method can return any primitive data type like string or any custom object.
IActionResult type - It is used when you are expecting multiple ActionResult return types such as 'NotFoundResult', 'OkObjectResult', 'BadRequestResult' from an action method.
ActionResult<T>
It allows you to return a type that derives from ActionResult type or some specific type like string.
For more visit Action return types in Web API.
Versioning in ASP.NET Core Web API:



11. How would you implement versioning in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ASP.NET Core, we add versioning using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning package.
We configure it in Program.cs and add version attributes to controllers. We can version by URL, header, or query string, and support multiple versions without breaking existing clients.
 What is API Versioning?
When you build an API, over time you will change or improve it.

But you can't break the old apps (mobile apps, websites) already using your old API.

Versioning lets you have multiple versions of your API side by side.
builder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options =>
{
    options.DefaultApiVersion = new ApiVersion(1, 0); // Default is v1.0
    options.AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified = true; // If no version is mentioned
    options.ReportApiVersions = true; // Shows available versions in headers
});




12. Explain the different versioning strategies (URI versioning, header versioning, query string versioning) and their pros and cons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 main versioning strategies in ASP.NET Core:

URI versioning adds the version in the path — it's clear and widely used.

Query string versioning uses a URL parameter like ?api-version=1.0 — simple but less RESTful.

Header versioning is cleaner but harder to test — it moves version info to the request headers.




13. How can you handle breaking changes in a versioned API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We handle breaking changes by creating a new API version, so existing clients are not affected.
We keep older versions running, mark them as deprecated, and clearly document what’s changed. This way, new features or changes don’t break the old experience.



Authentication and Authorization:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


14. Explain the difference between Authentication and Authorization in the context of ASP.NET Core Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authentication is the process of verifying who the user is — like checking a username, password, or token.
Authorization happens after that and decides what actions the user is allowed to perform — like checking roles or permissions. In ASP.NET Core, we use AddAuthentication() and AddAuthorization() to set them up.
Authentication = Who are you?
Authorization = What can you do?
In ASP.NET Core, you can use:

JWT tokens

Cookies

IdentityServer

OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
Authorization (Step 2)
"Are you allowed to do this?"

It checks permissions or roles

After authentication, the system checks:

Are you Admin?

Can you edit this record?

Are you allowed to see this data?
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult DeleteUser() { ... }





15. How would you implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ASP.NET Core, we implement JWT authentication by configuring the JWT bearer in Program.cs, issuing a token on successful login, and protecting endpoints with the [Authorize] attribute. 
The client stores the token and sends it in the Authorization header for every request. The server validates it to allow access.

What is JWT Authentication?
JWT = JSON Web Token
It’s like a digital ID card for the user, sent with every API request to prove who they are.
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
builder.Services.AddAuthentication("Bearer")
    .AddJwtBearer("Bearer", options =>
    {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateLifetime = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,

            ValidIssuer = "your-app",
            ValidAudience = "your-app",
            IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(
                Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSuperSecretKeyHere"))
        };
    });

builder.Services.AddAuthorization();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

============================================================================
[HttpPost("login")]
public IActionResult Login(UserLoginDto login)
{
    if (login.Username == "admin" && login.Password == "123")
    {
        var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
        var key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSuperSecretKeyHere");

        var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
            issuer: "your-app",
            audience: "your-app",
            expires: DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
            signingCredentials: new SigningCredentials(
                new SymmetricSecurityKey(key),
                SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature
            )
        );

        var tokenString = tokenHandler.WriteToken(token);
        return Ok(new { token = tokenString });
    }

    return Unauthorized();
}






16. What does JWT token contain? Explain about it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A JWT has three parts: the Header, which describes the algorithm and type; the Payload, which holds user data like username and roles; 
and the Signature, which ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with. The server uses the signature to validate the token on every request.

A JWT is a secure, compact string used to identify and authorize users.
Looks like this:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicm9sZSI6IkFkbWluIn0.
abc123xyz456SIGNATURE

JWT = Header . Payload . Signature
Header
"What kind of token is this, and how is it signed?"

Example:{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

alg = Algorithm used (e.g., HS256 = HMAC SHA-256)

typ = Type = JWT

 Payload (Claims)
"Who is the user? What roles or permissions do they have?"

Example:{
  "sub": "12345",
  "username": "admin",
  "role": "Admin",
  "exp": 1714334463
}
This part contains claims — user info and data:

sub: Subject (User ID)

username: Who logged in

role: User role (Admin, User, etc.)

exp: Expiry time (Unix timestamp)

✅ You can add custom claims too!

🧠 Payload is not encrypted — just base64 encoded. Don't put passwords here.

Signature
"Has this token been tampered with?"

Example:abc123xyz456SIGNATURE
Created by combining:

Header + Payload + secret key

Hashed using the algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA-256)

This is how the server verifies the token is valid and not fake.



17. How to validate JWT token in .NET Web APIs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To validate a JWT in .NET Web API, we configure JwtBearer authentication in Program.cs using TokenValidationParameters. 
Then we call app.UseAuthentication() and protect endpoints with [Authorize]. The framework automatically checks the token’s issuer, audience, expiry, and signature — and rejects invalid tokens.

What does “validating a JWT” mean?
It means:

🔐 Checking the token is real (not forged)

🕒 Checking it is not expired

🧑‍💼 Checking it is from a trusted issuer

✅ Checking the signature matches

.NET does all this automatically when properly configured.
Validate 4 things: Issuer, Audience, Expiry, Signature




18. What is the role of Identity Server in an ASP.NET Core Web API application?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IdentityServer acts as an authentication and authorization server for ASP.NET Core applications. It handles login, issues secure tokens like JWTs, and ensures APIs are accessed only by authorized users.
It follows standards like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, making it ideal for microservices, SSO, and secure API access.
IdentityServer is an Auth Server (not your Web API)

Your Web API trusts IdentityServer to authenticate users
IdentityServer is often used in microservices, enterprise systems, or B2B apps



19. How would you implement role-based authorization in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ASP.NET Core Web API, I implement role-based authorization by adding the user's role as a claim in the JWT token during login. 
Then, I protect endpoints using [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]. This ensures only users with specific roles can access certain actions like deleting users or modifying settings.


It means giving access to certain endpoints only if the user has a specific role — like “Admin”, “User”, or “Manager”.

Think of it as:

“Only Admins can delete. Users can only read.”
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
[HttpDelete("delete-user/{id}")]
public IActionResult DeleteUser(int id)
{
    return Ok("User deleted by Admin.");
}


Performance and Caching:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


20. How can you improve the performance of an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To improve performance in ASP.NET Core Web API, I use caching for repeated data, reduce response payloads with DTOs, make all I/O operations async, optimize SQL queries, and ensure the hosting environment is well configured. 
Small changes like using compression, avoiding overfetching, and indexing the database can make a big difference.
C.R.A.S.H.” — Cache, Reduce, Async, SQL, Host wisely”
– Cache frequently used data
IMemoryCache.Set("key", data);
 – Reduce data sent
 Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to avoid overfetching

Avoid sending full entity objects

Use Select() in LINQ to return only needed fields
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUsers() => 
    Ok(await _userService.GetAllAsync());


21. Explain the different caching techniques (in-memory caching, distributed caching, response caching) available in ASP.NET Core.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET Core supports three main caching techniques: In-Memory Caching stores data in RAM for quick access on a single server; Distributed Caching uses external stores like Redis, ideal for multi-server environments; 
and Response Caching stores full HTTP responses to reduce load on the server. Choosing the right one depends on scalability and data usage.
M.D.R. = Memory, Distributed, Response”
In-Memory Caching
Stored in the server’s RAM (fastest, but limited to one server)
 Distributed Caching
🌐 Stored in external store like Redis or SQL — shared across servers
Response Caching
📦 Caches the entire HTTP response (for GET requests)



22. How would you implement response caching in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ASP.NET Core Web API, I implement response caching by adding the UseResponseCaching middleware in Program.cs. 
Then, I apply the [ResponseCache] attribute to my controller actions to specify how long to cache responses and control caching behavior. This speeds up responses by caching them for repeated requests."

What is Response Caching?
Response Caching allows the entire HTTP response to be cached, which means subsequent requests for the same resource will be served much faster because we don’t have to generate the response again.

🧱 Steps to Implement Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API
Add the Response Caching Middleware
In Program.cs, you need to add the Response Caching middleware. This tells ASP.NET Core to cache the responses from the server.
builder.Services.AddResponseCaching();

Use the [ResponseCache] Attribute
[ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
[HttpGet("public-info")]
public IActionResult GetInfo()
{
    return Ok("This response is cached for 60 seconds.");
}

Control Caching Behavior with Additional Parameters
[ResponseCache(Duration = 60, VaryByQueryKeys = new[] { "id" })]
[HttpGet("product/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
{
    return Ok($"Product info for {id} - cached for 60 seconds.");
}




23. What is the purpose of the IMemoryCache interface in ASP.NET Core?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IMemoryCache interface in ASP.NET Core allows you to store data in memory for fast access. It helps reduce the load on external resources, like databases, by caching frequently used data temporarily. 
You can set expiration times to automatically clear the cache after a certain period, and manually remove items from the cache when necessary.
What is IMemoryCache?
IMemoryCache is like a super-fast, in-memory storage where you can store data temporarily to avoid fetching it over and over again from slow sources like a database or an API.
Store Data in Memory
You use IMemoryCache to cache data in the server's RAM. This is very fast because it avoids making expensive calls to databases or external APIs every time you need the data.
IMemoryCache _memoryCache;

public MyController(IMemoryCache memoryCache)
{
    _memoryCache = memoryCache;
}

public IActionResult GetData()
{
    // Check if the data is in the cache
    if (!_memoryCache.TryGetValue("myKey", out string cachedData))
    {
        // Data is not in cache, so fetch it (from DB or external API)
        cachedData = "Fetched from database";

        // Store it in the cache for 5 minutes
        _memoryCache.Set("myKey", cachedData, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
    }

    return Ok(cachedData);
}


🧠 Memory Trick:
“Cache Data Fast in Memory with IMemoryCache”

IMemoryCache = RAM Storage = Fast Access

Cache stuff in Set() and expire it with TimeSpan.



Advanced Routing:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



24. How would you implement attribute routing in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attribute Routing in ASP.NET Core allows you to define custom routes directly on controller actions using attributes like [Route], [HttpGet], and [HttpPost]. 
This gives you flexibility in defining cleaner and more specific routes, and you can include dynamic parameters in the route, like IDs. It's especially useful for creating RESTful APIs with intuitive and descriptive URLs.
Memory Trick:
“Attribute Routing = Route at the Method Level”

Use [Route] on Controller = Prefix for all actions

Use [HttpGet], [HttpPost], etc. = Define exact method routes

Use {} in routes = Dynamic parts like IDs
Define Routes Using Attributes
You define the route directly on the controller methods using the Route or HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpPut, etc., attributes. The route can include placeholders, making it dynamic.

Example:
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    // GET api/products
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetAllProducts()
    {
        return Ok("Returning all products");
    }

    // GET api/products/5
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetProductById(int id)
    {
        return Ok($"Returning product with ID: {id}");
    }

    // POST api/products
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] Product product)
    {
        return Ok("Product created");
    }
}


Using Placeholders in Routes
You can use placeholders like {id} to define dynamic parts of the route. These will be replaced with actual values when a request is made.
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
{
    return Ok($"Product with ID: {id}");
}



25. Explain the concept of constraint routing and provide an example.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constraint routing in ASP.NET Core is used to restrict route parameters using conditions like type, length, or format.
For example, you can enforce that an ID must be an integer by using {id:int} in the route. This helps with route matching, URL validation, and avoiding invalid requests.
What is Constraint Routing?
Constraint Routing in ASP.NET Core means restricting what values are allowed in the route URL using rules (called constraints).
[Route("api/products")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    // Only match if id is an integer
    [HttpGet("{id:int}")]
    public IActionResult GetById(int id)
    {
        return Ok($"Product ID is {id}");
    }

    // Only match if name is at least 3 characters
    [HttpGet("search/{name:minlength(3)}")]
    public IActionResult SearchByName(string name)
    {
        return Ok($"Search result for {name}");
    }
}




26. How can you implement custom route constraints in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To implement a custom route constraint in ASP.NET Core, I create a class that implements IRouteConstraint and write logic to validate the route value. 
Then, I register the constraint in RouteOptions and use it in my route like a built-in constraint. This is useful when I need custom rules—for example, only allowing certain country codes in the route.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"IRouteConstraint + Register + Use in Route = Custom Rule!"


What are Custom Route Constraints?
A custom route constraint is when you define your own rule to control what values are allowed in a route.

Built-in constraints like int, bool, or minlength are helpful—but what if you want to allow only certain strings (like country codes or specific formats)? That's where custom constraints come in.

 1. Create the Custom Constraint Class
 You create a class that implements IRouteConstraint.

Here’s an example: only allow the value to be “india”, “usa”, or “uk” in lowercase.
public class CountryCodeConstraint : IRouteConstraint
{
    private static readonly string[] AllowedCountries = { "india", "usa", "uk" };

    public bool Match(HttpContext httpContext,
                      IRouter route,
                      string routeKey,
                      RouteValueDictionary values,
                      RouteDirection routeDirection)
    {
        if (values.TryGetValue(routeKey, out var value))
        {
            var country = value?.ToString()?.ToLower();
            return AllowedCountries.Contains(country);
        }
        return false;
    }
}


Register the Constraint in Program.cs
You need to tell ASP.NET Core about your custom constraint by registering it:
builder.Services.Configure<RouteOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ConstraintMap.Add("countrycode", typeof(CountryCodeConstraint));
});

Use the Constraint in Your Route
[HttpGet("country/{code:countrycode}")]
public IActionResult GetByCountry(string code)
{
    return Ok($"Country: {code.ToUpper()}");
}





Dependency Injection:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27. Explain the concept of Dependency Injection and its benefits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from the outside instead of creating them itself. 
In ASP.NET Core, it's built-in and used to inject services like logging, data access, or custom services into controllers. The main benefits are loose coupling, easier testing, and better maintainability.
🧠 Memory Trick:
“Don’t create your own tools — ask for them to be delivered.”
That’s Dependency Injection: Ask for what you need, and the system provides it.

| Benefit                       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------------   |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Loose Coupling**         | Classes depend on interfaces, not concrete classes — easier to change things |
| ✅ **Easier to Test**         | You can pass mock or fake objects during unit testing                        |
| ✅ **More Maintainable**      | Changes in dependencies don’t affect the consumer                            |
| ✅ **Built-in in ASP.NET Core** | No extra setup or library needed — it's already there                        |

What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection (DI) is a way to give an object (like a controller or service) the things it needs—instead of creating them itself.

Think of it like this:

“Don’t cook your own food, just get it delivered to you.”
Example (Real-Life Analogy)
Let’s say you’re a Car.

A Car needs an Engine to run.

Instead of the Car creating its own Engine, the Engine is given (injected) to it.

That’s Dependency Injection — the Engine (dependency) is injected into the Car (consumer).





28. How would you register and resolve dependencies in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ASP.NET Core, we register dependencies using builder.Services in Program.cs—for example, using AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>(). Then, we resolve them by requesting the dependency in the constructor of a controller or service.
This allows ASP.NET Core to automatically inject the required object. It's built-in and supports different lifetimes like Singleton, Scoped, and Transient.

🧠 Memory Trick:
“Register in Program.cs, Resolve by asking in the constructor.”

| Method          | Lifetime                          | Example Use Case             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `AddSingleton`  | One instance for the whole app    | App-wide settings, cache     |
| `AddScoped`     | One per HTTP request              | Business logic services      |
| `AddTransient`  | New instance every time           | Lightweight, stateless tasks |


What Does “Register and Resolve Dependencies” Mean?
Register = Tell ASP.NET Core what service to use when a type is needed.

Resolve = ASP.NET Core will automatically create and provide that service when it’s needed (like in a controller).
Think of it like:

“Menu (register) tells the waiter what food is available.
“Order (resolve) brings that food to your table automatically.”



29. In dependency injection, how do constructor injection, property injection, and method injection differ in terms of their implementation and usage?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Dependency Injection, constructor injection is the most common and injects required dependencies when the object is created. Property injection sets dependencies via public properties, useful for optional values. 
Method injection passes dependencies directly to methods when needed. Constructor injection is preferred in ASP.NET Core for clean, testable, and enforced setup.

| Type               | How Injected              | When to Use                    | ASP.NET Core Friendly? |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Constructor**    | In the constructor         | Required dependencies          | ✅ Yes (default)        |
| **Property**       | Through public properties  | Optional or late-loaded deps   | ⚠️ Manual or `[FromServices]` |
| **Method**         | As method parameters       | Short-lived or one-time deps   | ✅ Yes (if called manually) |




30. How can you resolve circular dependencies in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Circular dependencies occur when two or more services depend on each other, causing an infinite loop. To resolve this, I usually redesign the service structure to remove tight coupling, or use techniques like Lazy injection, method injection, or property injection to break the loop.
The best solution is always to rethink the architecture to avoid circular logic.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"Circular dependency = infinite loop of waiting"
Fix it by restructuring, delaying, or injecting only when needed.
What is a Circular Dependency?
A circular dependency happens when Service A depends on Service B, and Service B also depends on Service A—directly or indirectly.

🧠 Think of it like:

"You need me to start, but I also need you to start. So neither of us can start!"

Example of Circular Dependency:

public class ServiceA
{
    public ServiceA(ServiceB b) { }
}

public class ServiceB
{
    public ServiceB(ServiceA a) { }
}
How to Fix It (Ways to Resolve):
✅ 1. Re-Design Your Services (Best Option)
Split the logic into smaller services.

Use interfaces to break the loop.

🔧 Example: Use IServiceA in ServiceB and vice versa, then restructure logic to avoid mutual constructor calls.
2. Use Lazy Injection (Lazy<T>)
public class ServiceA
{
    private readonly Lazy<ServiceB> _serviceB;
    public ServiceA(Lazy<ServiceB> serviceB) => _serviceB = serviceB;
}
 3. Use Method Injection (Inject dependency when needed)
 public class ServiceA
{
    public void UseB(ServiceB b) => b.DoSomething();
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




31. Explain the built-in logging providers in ASP.NET Core and their use cases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET Core provides built-in logging providers like Console, Debug, EventLog, and AzureAppServices. Each provider sends log messages to different targets—for example, Console logs are great for development, and EventLog is useful on Windows servers. 
I typically register them in Program.cs using builder.Logging.AddConsole() or similar methods, and I log messages with ILogger by level like Information, Warning, or Error.
🧠 Memory Trick:
“C-D-E” → Console, Debug, EventLog — your core built-in providers.

 What Are Logging Providers?
Logging providers are the tools that write your logs somewhere—like to the console, a file, or external systems.

ASP.NET Core has built-in support for several logging providers that you can use without installing anything extra.
| Provider             | What It Does                          | Use Case Example                           |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Console`            | Logs to the terminal or command prompt | Dev/test environments, quick debugging      |
| `Debug`              | Logs to Visual Studio Output window    | Use during development                      |
| `EventSource`        | Logs to ETW (Event Tracing for Windows)| Use with Windows-based diagnostics tools    |
| `EventLog` (Windows) | Logs to Windows Event Viewer           | Apps running on Windows servers             |
| `TraceSource`        | Works with `System.Diagnostics`        | For legacy support or fine-grained control  |
| `AzureAppServices`   | Logs to Azure log streaming            | Apps hosted on Azure                        |


How to Use in ASP.NET Core (Program.cs):
Logging is automatically set up in Program.cs:
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add built-in logging providers
builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
builder.Logging.AddConsole();
builder.Logging.AddDebug();
builder.Logging.AddEventLog(); // For Windows


You can log messages like this anywhere (e.g., in controllers or services):
private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;

public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public IActionResult Index()
{
    _logger.LogInformation("This is an info log!");
    return View();
}





32. How would you implement custom logging in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To implement custom logging in ASP.NET Core, I create a class that implements ILogger to define how logs are written, and a class that implements ILoggerProvider to create logger instances. 
Then I register my provider in Program.cs using builder.Logging.AddProvider(). This lets me write logs to custom targets like a file, database, or third-party API.

🧠 Memory Trick:
“Logger → Provider → Register”
Write your logic, wrap it in a provider, plug it into the app.

What is Custom Logging?
Custom logging means creating your own logging logic — either to write logs to a file, database, external API, or format them your way — instead of only using the built-in ones like Console or Debug.

public class MyCustomLoggerProvider : ILoggerProvider
{
    public ILogger CreateLogger(string categoryName)
    {
        return new MyCustomLogger(categoryName);
    }

    public void Dispose() { }
}

Create a Custom Logger Provider
public class MyCustomLoggerProvider : ILoggerProvider
{
    public ILogger CreateLogger(string categoryName)
    {
        return new MyCustomLogger(categoryName);
    }

    public void Dispose() { }
}

Register Your Custom Logger in Program.cs
builder.Logging.ClearProviders(); // Optional: remove built-in ones
builder.Logging.AddProvider(new MyCustomLoggerProvider());




33. What is the role of Application Insights in monitoring an ASP.NET Core Web API?     
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application Insights is a monitoring tool from Azure that tracks performance, failures, and user behavior in an ASP.NET Core Web API. It can automatically collect data like requests, exceptions, dependencies, and more. 
I enable it with AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry() in Program.cs, and it sends logs to the Azure portal for real-time monitoring and alerting.

🧠 Memory Hook:
“Insights = Inside View”
It tells you what’s going on inside your API.


 What is Application Insights?
Application Insights is a monitoring tool from Azure that helps you track the performance, errors, and usage of your ASP.NET Core Web API in real time.

Think of it like:

“A smart black box” that records what’s going on inside your API — so you can detect issues, measure performance, and understand user behavior.




34. How can you set up distributed tracing in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributed tracing allows us to track a single request as it flows through multiple services. In ASP.NET Core, we can use OpenTelemetry to collect and export trace data. 
I configure it in Program.cs using AddOpenTelemetry() and plug in exporters like Console, Jaeger, or Azure Monitor. This helps debug latency and failures across microservices.

🧠 Memory Hook:
“OpenTelemetry = Open Trace Highway”
Let your requests leave footprints across services.


What is Distributed Tracing?
Distributed tracing helps you track a request across multiple services (APIs, databases, queues) — showing how long each part takes and where problems happen.

🧠 Think of it like:

A GPS for requests that shows the full path a request travels, even across microservices.

35. Explain the concept of gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) and its advantages over traditional REST APIs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gRPC is a high-performance, modern RPC framework that allows services to communicate more efficiently than traditional REST APIs. It uses Protocol Buffers (a compact binary format), enabling faster serialization and transmission of data. Unlike REST, gRPC supports bidirectional streaming and provides built-in features like authentication and load balancing.
It's especially useful for microservices and real-time systems where performance and scalability are critical.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"gRPC = Fast, Binary, Streaming"
It’s the fast lane for communication.

What is gRPC?
gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Calls) is a modern, high-performance RPC framework that allows services to communicate with each other efficiently. It uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its default data format, which is fast, compact, and easy to use.

Think of it like:

gRPC is like sending a letter to a friend (a service) where you ask them to perform a task for you. Instead of using a long, detailed letter (like REST), gRPC sends a small, easy-to-read note that gets the job done faster.
| Feature                     | gRPC                           | REST                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Performance**              | Very fast (uses Protobuf)       | Slower (uses JSON)             |
| **Communication Type**       | Supports bidirectional streaming | Request/Response only          |
| **Serialization Format**     | Protobuf (binary, compact)      | JSON (text, larger)            |
| **Built-in Features**        | Authentication, load balancing, retries, deadlines, etc. | Needs extra setup             |
| **Compatibility**            | Supports many languages (C#, Java, Go, Python, etc.) | Broadly supported, but no out-of-box support for streaming |






36. How would you implement GraphQL in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To implement GraphQL in an ASP.NET Core Web API, I first install the necessary GraphQL packages like GraphQL and GraphQL.Server. I then define a schema with types and queries, register services in Program.cs, and map the GraphQL endpoint using app.MapGraphQL(). 
This lets clients make flexible queries, retrieving only the data they need, and also allows for real-time subscriptions and mutations.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"GraphQL = Flexible, Query-Driven, Efficient"
It gives clients power over data retrieval.

What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. 
It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. Unlike REST, which gives predefined responses, GraphQL gives flexibility and efficiency by allowing the client to specify which fields it wants in a response.

Key Concepts of GraphQL:
Query: A way to ask for specific data.

Mutation: A way to change data (similar to POST/PUT in REST).

Subscription: Real-time updates to data (think live chat or notifications).

Schema: Defines types, queries, and mutations available in your API.






37. What are the benefits of using SignalR in an ASP.NET Core Web API for real-time communication?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SignalR is a real-time communication library in ASP.NET Core that allows the server to push updates to connected clients.
It’s perfect for applications requiring instant data, like chat apps, live notifications, or dashboards. SignalR offers automatic reconnection, multiple transport protocols, and scalable communication, making it ideal for building responsive, real-time systems.


🧠 Memory Trick:
"SignalR = Real-Time, Push, Scalable"
It helps send instant updates to clients efficiently.

What is SignalR?
SignalR is a library for adding real-time functionality to your web applications. It enables bi-directional communication between the server and clients over a persistent connection. This is perfect for scenarios like live updates, chat applications, notifications, or anything that needs real-time data.

Key Benefits of Using SignalR in ASP.NET Core:
1. Real-Time Communication 🕒
SignalR allows the server to push updates to clients instantly, without waiting for the client to request the information.

For example, imagine a live sports score update or a live chat feature—SignalR makes it seamless.

2. Automatic Reconnection 🔄
If a connection is lost, SignalR automatically reconnects without needing you to write complex logic.

This is especially useful for mobile apps or users with unstable connections.

3. Supports Multiple Protocols 🌐
SignalR automatically chooses the best transport method, such as WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or Long Polling.

It adapts based on the client and network conditions, ensuring the best performance.

4. Scalable for Multiple Clients 📈
SignalR efficiently manages connections with many clients at once.

With SignalR backplane, you can scale across multiple servers, allowing a larger number of clients to receive real-time updates.

5. Push Notifications 📲
It’s ideal for push notifications in real-time applications. For example, instantly notifying users of new messages, updates, or events without needing them to refresh the page.

6. Simplifies Communication Logic 💬
SignalR abstracts away complex details of managing client-server communication. You don’t need to manually manage connections, open/close sockets, or track client states — SignalR does it for you.



🔹 Step 1: Add SignalR NuGet Package
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR

🔹 Step 2: Set Up SignalR Hub
public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        // Send message to all clients connected to this hub
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
}


🔹 Step 3: Configure SignalR in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddSignalR();

🔹 Step 4: Map the Hub Endpoint
app.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");

🔹 Step 5: Client-Side Integration

const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chathub")
    .build();

connection.on("ReceiveMessage", function(user, message) {
    console.log(user + ": " + message);
});

connection.start().catch(function(err) {
    return console.error(err.toString());
});





38. How can you implement event-driven architectures using Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an event-driven architecture, services communicate by sending events via message queues like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. In ASP.NET Core, I would use these queues to publish events, like when a new order is created. Other services can subscribe to these events and act accordingly. 
I set this up by installing the appropriate NuGet packages, configuring the publisher and consumer logic, and using background services to handle the events asynchronously.

🧠 Memory Trick:
“Event-Driven = Publish-Subscribe”
Publish an event → Subscribe to receive and react to it.

What is Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)?
Event-driven architecture is a design pattern where services communicate by sending and receiving events. These events represent state changes or actions that other services need to respond to, like new orders or user registrations.

With message queues (like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus), we decouple services and allow them to react to events asynchronously, leading to better scalability and flexibility.

Why Use Message Queues?
Message queues like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus provide reliable, asynchronous communication between services. They help with:

Decoupling: Services don’t need to know about each other directly, just the events that they care about.

Asynchronous Processing: Services can process messages at their own pace, without blocking other services.

Fault Tolerance: Messages are stored in queues, and if one service goes down, it can process the messages once it’s back online.

Scalability: The system can scale easily by adding more consumers to process messages from the queue.


 How to Implement Event-Driven Architecture with Message Queues in ASP.NET Core:
🔹 Step 1: Install NuGet Packages
If using RabbitMQ, add the following package:
dotnet add package RabbitMQ.Client
For Azure Service Bus, use:
dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus


🔹 Step 2: Set Up the Message Queue Service

using RabbitMQ.Client;

public class RabbitMqService
{
    private readonly IConnection _connection;
    private readonly IModel _channel;

    public RabbitMqService()
    {
        var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
        _connection = factory.CreateConnection();
        _channel = _connection.CreateModel();
    }

    public void PublishMessage(string message)
    {
        _channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "eventQueue", durable: false, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false, arguments: null);
        var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);

        _channel.BasicPublish(exchange: "", routingKey: "eventQueue", basicProperties: null, body: body);
    }

    public void SubscribeToQueue()
    {
        _channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "eventQueue", durable: false, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false, arguments: null);
        var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(_channel);
        consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
        {
            var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ea.Body.ToArray());
            Console.WriteLine($"Received message: {message}");
        };

        _channel.BasicConsume(queue: "eventQueue", autoAck: true, consumer: consumer);
    }
}



🔹 Step 3: Use Dependency Injection
builder.Services.AddSingleton<RabbitMqService>();


🔹 Step 4: Publish Events (e.g., Order Created)
In your controller, you can publish an event to notify other services:
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly RabbitMqService _rabbitMqService;

    public OrderController(RabbitMqService rabbitMqService)
    {
        _rabbitMqService = rabbitMqService;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateOrder([FromBody] Order order)
    {
        // Save order to DB (not shown)

        // Publish event to message queue
        _rabbitMqService.PublishMessage($"Order {order.Id} created.");

        return Ok(new { Message = "Order created and event published!" });
    }
}


🔹 Step 5: Handle Events (e.g., Inventory Update)
For the consumer to handle the event, it could be set up as a background service that listens to the queue:
public class EventListenerService : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly RabbitMqService _rabbitMqService;

    public EventListenerService(RabbitMqService rabbitMqService)
    {
        _rabbitMqService = rabbitMqService;
    }

    protected override Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        _rabbitMqService.SubscribeToQueue();  // Listen for events
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
Register the background service in Program.cs:
builder.Services.AddHostedService<EventListenerService>();



Error Handling:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

39. How would you implement a global exception handler in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an ASP.NET Core Web API, I would implement a global exception handler using custom middleware. The middleware catches all unhandled exceptions, logs them, and then returns a consistent error response to the client with an appropriate status code and message. 
I also ensure to handle specific exceptions like ValidationException or NotFoundException differently to give more meaningful error responses.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"Global Exception = Catch, Log, Respond"
Catch errors → Log them → Respond with a friendly message.

What is a Global Exception Handler?
A global exception handler catches unhandled exceptions that occur throughout your application, ensuring that they are logged and a consistent response is sent back to the client.

Instead of manually handling exceptions in each action method, a global exception handler makes your code cleaner and provides uniform error responses.

 Why Use a Global Exception Handler?
Consistency: Ensures that error responses have a consistent format (e.g., status code, message).

Logging: Automatically logs unexpected errors for easier debugging and monitoring.

User Experience: Prevents the application from crashing and provides friendly error messages to users.

 How to Implement a Global Exception Handler in ASP.NET Core Web API:
🔹 Step 1: Create a Custom Middleware for Exception Handling
A middleware can catch exceptions globally in the request pipeline.
public class GlobalExceptionMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<GlobalExceptionMiddleware> _logger;

    public GlobalExceptionMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<GlobalExceptionMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context);  // Proceed with the request pipeline
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "An unexpected error occurred.");
            context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError;
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
            await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new
            {
                message = "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
            }));
        }
    }
}

🔹 Step 2: Register the Middleware in Program.cs
Next, we need to register the custom middleware in the request pipeline:
public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Add the global exception handler middleware before others
        app.UseMiddleware<GlobalExceptionMiddleware>();

        // Other middlewares (routing, authorization, etc.)
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}

🔹 Step 3: Optional - Handle Specific Exception Types
You can also extend the global exception handler to handle specific exceptions (e.g., ValidationException, NotFoundException) differently:
catch (ValidationException ex)
{
    context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest;
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new
    {
        message = ex.Message,
        details = ex.ValidationErrors
    }));
}
catch (NotFoundException ex)
{
    context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status404NotFound;
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new
    {
        message = ex.Message
    }));
}


🔹 Step 4: Use Custom Exception Classes (Optional)
For better organization, you can create custom exception classes (e.g., NotFoundException or BadRequestException) to represent specific error conditions in your application.
public class NotFoundException : Exception
{
    public NotFoundException(string message) : base(message) { }
}
Then, you can throw these exceptions in your controllers when needed:
public IActionResult GetItem(int id)
{
    var item = _service.GetItemById(id);
    if (item == null)
    {
        throw new NotFoundException($"Item with ID {id} not found.");
    }
    return Ok(item);
}


🔹 Step 5: Logging Errors
Make sure you use a logging framework (e.g., Serilog, NLog, log4net) to log exceptions, so you can trace issues later. In the example above, we're using ILogger.



40. What are the different types of HTTP status codes you can use to indicate different error scenarios in a Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Interview Quick Answer:
“In an ASP.NET Core Web API, I would use different HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request. For instance:

A 200 OK means the request was successful.

A 400 Bad Request is used when the request has invalid data.

A 401 Unauthorized is used when authentication is required.

A 404 Not Found is used when the resource doesn’t exist.

A 500 Internal Server Error indicates a server-side issue."

🧠 Memory Trick:
"2xx = Success, 4xx = Client Error, 5xx = Server Error"
Remember: 2xx is good (success), 4xx is bad (client issues), and 5xx is something wrong with the server.



What Are HTTP Status Codes?
HTTP status codes are part of the response returned by the server when a request is made to a Web API. These codes indicate whether the request was successful, failed, or if there’s an error that needs attention. They are categorized into 5 classes based on their first digit.



41. How would you handle and log unhandled exceptions in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an ASP.NET Core Web API, I would implement global exception handling using custom middleware. The middleware would catch any unhandled exceptions, log them for debugging purposes using the built-in ILogger, and return a consistent error response to the client.
This ensures that the application doesn’t crash and the client always gets a user-friendly error message.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"Catch → Log → Respond"
Catch exceptions → Log for debugging → Respond with a consistent error message.

What is Unhandled Exception Handling?
Unhandled exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a request, and they don’t have specific error handling code in the controller or service. When an exception occurs and is not caught, it can cause the application to crash, which is undesirable.

In a Web API, it’s crucial to catch these exceptions globally, log them for later investigation, and return a consistent error response to the client



42. Explain the concept of model validation in Web APIs and how you would handle validation errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an ASP.NET Core Web API, I would handle model validation using data annotations like [Required], [StringLength], and [Range]. I would also use the [ApiController] attribute to enable automatic model validation.
If validation fails, the API will return a 400 Bad Request with the error details. Additionally, I could customize the error response or implement custom validation logic for complex scenarios.
🧠 Memory Trick:
"Validate Early → Handle Errors → Respond Clearly"
Validate data early, handle any errors, and send clear, structured responses.

What is Model Validation?
In a Web API, model validation is the process of checking whether the incoming data (typically from the client) meets the rules and requirements before it’s processed by the application. This ensures that only valid data gets saved to the database or used in business logic.

When a client sends a request with data, that data is usually deserialized into a model. Model validation checks if the data in that model is correct (e.g., required fields are present, data types are correct, values are within acceptable ranges).

🔹 Step 1: Use Data Annotations in the Model
public class UserModel
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required.")]
    [StringLength(100, ErrorMessage = "Name cannot be longer than 100 characters.")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Email is required.")]
    [EmailAddress(ErrorMessage = "Invalid email format.")]
    public string Email { get; set; }

    [Range(18, 99, ErrorMessage = "Age must be between 18 and 99.")]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

🔹 Step 2: Use the [ApiController] Attribute:

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateUser([FromBody] UserModel user)
    {
        // If the model is invalid, ASP.NET Core automatically returns a 400 response
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest(ModelState);
        }

        // Continue with processing the valid user data...
        return Ok("User created successfully.");
    }
}


🔹 Step 3: Handling Validation Errors
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult CreateUser([FromBody] UserModel user)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        // Customize the response
        var errors = ModelState
            .Where(e => e.Value.Errors.Count > 0)
            .Select(e => new
            {
                Field = e.Key,
                Errors = e.Value.Errors.Select(x => x.ErrorMessage)
            });

        return BadRequest(new { Message = "Validation failed", Errors = errors });
    }

    return Ok("User created successfully.");
}




Request/Response Formatting:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


43. How would you implement content negotiation in an ASP.NET Core Web API to support different response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an ASP.NET Core Web API, I would implement content negotiation by enabling support for multiple formats such as JSON and XML. By default, ASP.NET Core uses the Accept header to determine the response format. I would also use the AddXmlSerializerFormatters() method to add XML support. 
This allows clients to request data in their preferred format, making the API flexible and easy to integrate with different systems.
🧠 Memory Trick:
"Accept → Content Negotiation → Response Format"
Clients send an Accept header → API negotiates the format → Sends the response in that format.

 What is Content Negotiation?
Content negotiation is the process by which the server and client agree on the format of the response. In a Web API, this typically means deciding whether the response will be in JSON, XML, YAML, or other formats based on the client’s request.

When the client makes a request to your Web API, it can specify what format it wants in the Accept header. Based on this header, the server can then return the appropriate format for the response.

💡 Why is Content Negotiation Important?
Flexibility: Clients can request different formats based on their needs.

Interoperability: It allows different systems (e.g., web apps, mobile apps, or other APIs) to consume the API in their preferred format.

Scalability: You don’t have to create separate endpoints for each format; the same endpoint can support multiple formats.




44. What are the different ways to format the request and response bodies in a Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a Web API, the request and response bodies can be formatted in multiple ways depending on client preferences and system requirements. Common formats include JSON, which is widely used for its simplicity; XML, for more structured data; YAML, for human-readable configurations; and Form Data, which is used for simple web forms. 
In ASP.NET Core, JSON is the default, but you can add support for XML and other formats by configuring services. The format is typically determined by the client’s Accept header.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"JSON → XML → YAML → Form Data"
Start with JSON as default, use XML for complex needs, YAML for readability, and Form Data for simple key-value pairs.

🚀 What is Request and Response Body Formatting?
In a Web API, the request body is the data sent by the client to the server, and the response body is the data sent back by the server to the client. The format of these bodies is crucial for ensuring that both the client and server can understand each other.

There are different ways to format the request and response bodies depending on the data format required. Common formats include JSON, XML, YAML, and others.

The most common formats:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

XML (Extensible Markup Language)

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)

Form Data (used in web forms)



45. How would you handle large file uploads and downloads in a Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To handle large file uploads in an ASP.NET Core Web API, I would use streaming to handle the file in chunks, reducing memory usage. I would also configure the max request body size to ensure the server can accept large files. For file downloads, I would use streaming to send the file to the client in chunks, avoiding memory overload. 
This way, we can handle large files efficiently without causing performance issues.
🧠 Memory Trick:
"Stream → Process in Chunks → Avoid Memory Overflow"
For uploads and downloads: Stream the file and process it in chunks to handle large files without memory overload.

🚀 What is the Challenge with Large File Uploads and Downloads?
When dealing with large files, there are several factors to keep in mind:

Performance: Large files can impact memory usage and slow down the server.

Timeouts: Uploading or downloading large files might exceed request timeouts.

Concurrency: Simultaneous uploads or downloads of large files can overload the server.

We can handle these challenges with proper techniques to ensure the server performs efficiently and users can upload or download large files without issues.




46. Explain the concept of data shaping (projections) and how you would implement it in an ASP.NET Core Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data shaping, or projections, is the process of transforming data into a specific structure or format that is tailored to the client's needs. In ASP.NET Core, this can be done using LINQ to project entities into Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that only include the required fields. For more advanced scenarios, you can use AutoMapper to simplify the projection process. 
Additionally, you can allow dynamic data shaping, where clients can specify the fields they want in the response via query parameters.
🧠 Memory Trick:
"Project → Transform → Serve"
You project data using LINQ or AutoMapper, transform it into a simpler shape, and then serve it to the client.

🚀 What is Data Shaping (Projections)?
Data shaping or projections is the process of transforming the data retrieved from a database or other data source into a specific shape that fits the needs of the client, without returning the entire data model.

This is especially useful when you want to expose only a subset of data to the client, which can help in:

Improving performance: By sending only the necessary data.

Reducing over-fetching: The client doesn't get unnecessary fields that they don’t need.

Ensuring security: Sensitive data can be excluded from the response.

🔹 1. Using LINQ Projections
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUsers()
{
    var users = await _context.Users
        .Select(user => new UserDto
        {
            Id = user.Id,
            FirstName = user.FirstName,
            LastName = user.LastName
        })
        .ToListAsync();

    return Ok(users);
}
🔹 2. Using AutoMapper (Optional)
Install-Package AutoMapper
Install-Package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection

🔹 3. Shaping Data Dynamically (Optional)
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUsers([FromQuery] string fields)
{
    var selectedFields = fields?.Split(',');

    var usersQuery = _context.Users.AsQueryable();

    // Dynamically select only the requested fields
    if (selectedFields != null && selectedFields.Contains("FirstName"))
    {
        usersQuery = usersQuery.Select(user => new UserDto
        {
            Id = user.Id,
            FirstName = user.FirstName,
            LastName = user.LastName
        });
    }

    var users = await usersQuery.ToListAsync();
    return Ok(users);
}





47. How will you format response data in ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ASP.NET Core Web API, response data is formatted using formatters like JSON (default) or XML. The framework uses content negotiation to decide which format to return, based on the client's ‘Accept’ header. We can also explicitly configure or force a specific format in the controller. 
To support XML, we just add the XML formatter in the services.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"JSON by default, XML with setup, Accept header drives format!"

🚀 What Does "Formatting Response Data" Mean?
In ASP.NET Core Web API, response formatting means how the data is shaped and sent back to the client — usually in JSON, XML, or another format.

For example:

You might want your API to return data as JSON (default).

Or return it as XML if the client requests it.




48. Explain the custom formatters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interview Quick Answer:
“Custom formatters in ASP.NET Core let us define how the API should read or write data in formats other than JSON or XML, like CSV or plain text. We create a class that inherits from TextOutputFormatter or TextInputFormatter, override the read/write methods, and register it in the controller options. This gives us full control over the response format.”

🧠 Memory Trick:
"Custom formatter = teach API a new language (like CSV)"
"Create class → override write method → register → use"
🎨 What Are Custom Formatters?
A custom formatter in ASP.NET Core Web API is a way to control how your API inputs or outputs data — especially if the default JSON or XML format isn’t what you need.

Think of it like teaching your API to speak a new language (e.g., CSV, plain text, YAML).

🤔 Why Use a Custom Formatter?
Your client wants CSV data instead of JSON.

You want to log data in a specific custom format.

You want to accept a special format in a request (e.g., custom headers or body layout).





Security:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



49. How would you implement rate limiting in an ASP.NET Core Web API to prevent abuse or denial of service attacks?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚦 What is Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting means controlling how many times a user can call your API in a given time window.

📌 It helps protect your API from abuse, bots, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.


✅ Why Use Rate Limiting?
Protects API from overuse or attacks

Ensures fair usage for all users

Saves resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth)

Improves security and stability

Rate limiting is used to control how often clients can call the API, to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. In ASP.NET Core, we can use the AspNetCoreRateLimit package to apply IP-based rate limits. We configure general rules in appsettings.json, register the services in the Program.cs, and add the middleware to enforce it. 
If the limit is crossed, the user gets a 429 Too Many Requests response.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"Rate limit = throttle API usage like a speed limit on a road."
"Use middleware, set rules in config, protect from abuse."





50. Explain the concept of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and how you would mitigate it in a Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSRF is when a malicious site tricks a logged-in user’s browser into making unintended requests to a trusted server. In Web APIs, CSRF is usually prevented by using token-based authentication like JWT instead of cookies. Since tokens are not automatically sent by the browser like cookies, CSRF attacks can’t occur. 
For web apps using cookies, ASP.NET Core provides anti-forgery tokens to verify that a request is truly from the authenticated user.

🧠 Memory Trick:
“CSRF = Trick browser to make a bad request”
“JWT = Manual tokens, no auto cookies → Safe from CSRF”

🛑 What is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?
CSRF is an attack where a user is tricked into making an unwanted request to your server — without knowing it.

🔍 Simple Example:
Let’s say you're logged into a banking site, and then visit a malicious site. That malicious site silently sends a POST request to transfer money from your bank account — using your logged-in session/cookies.

You didn’t click “Send Money” on the bank site — but it happened because the site trusted your browser's session.




51. How would you implement input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To prevent SQL injection, I always use Entity Framework or parameterized queries — never build raw SQL with string concatenation. For XSS, I validate and sanitize all input, use data annotations to restrict content length and format, and encode outputs when displaying user input. 
In Web APIs, the key is to treat all user input as untrusted and validate it at the model level before using it.

🧠 Memory Trick:
"Never trust user input. Validate early. Escape output. Use ORM, not string queries."

🛠️ How to Prevent SQL Injection in ASP.NET Core
✅ Use Parameterized Queries or ORM (like EF Core)
❌ Bad (vulnerable to SQL injection):
var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = '{userInput}'";

✅ Good (safe with parameters):
context.Users.Where(u => u.Name == userInput);


52. Explain the concept of API keys and how you would implement them in an ASP.NET Core Web API for authentication and authorization.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API keys are tokens sent with each request to identify and authorize clients. In ASP.NET Core, I can implement them using custom middleware that checks for the key in the request headers. If the key is valid, the request is allowed to proceed.
It's a simple and effective way to protect public or internal APIs, though for more secure user-based access, I’d prefer JWT or OAuth.

🧠 Memory Tip:
“API Key = simple secret in header. Middleware checks it. Allow or block.”

🔐 What Is an API Key?
An API key is a unique token (usually a string) given to a client (user/app) to identify and authorize access to your API.

Think of it like a door key – if you have the correct key, you’re allowed in.

🧠 Why Use API Keys?
✅ Simple to implement
✅ Good for server-to-server communication
✅ Useful for monitoring usage per client
❌ Not secure enough for user login systems



Testing:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


53. What are the different types of testing you would perform for an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I perform unit tests to validate logic in isolation, integration tests to ensure components work together, and end-to-end tests to cover full user scenarios. 
I also include performance tests to measure scalability, security tests to guard against attacks, and smoke tests after deployment to check basic functionality


✅ 1. Unit Testing
🔍 What: Test individual pieces like controllers, services, or methods in isolation.
🧪 Goal: Make sure each method does what it’s supposed to do.

📦 Tools: xUnit, Moq

Example: Test if a GetUserById(id) method returns the correct user.

🗣 Interview line:
“I use unit tests to test individual components like controllers or services with mocked dependencies.”

✅ 2. Integration Testing
🔍 What: Test how different parts of the application work together — especially database, services, and API endpoints.
🧪 Goal: Ensure all components work well as a whole.

📦 Tools: xUnit, TestServer, HttpClient

Example: Call /api/users and check if it fetches data from the real or test database.

🗣 Interview line:
“I use integration tests to test full API behavior from endpoint to database.”

✅ 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
🔍 What: Simulates real user interaction across the full system.
🧪 Goal: Test the entire flow — from frontend to API and database.

📦 Tools: Postman, Selenium, or frontend testing tools

Example: Test a full login and dashboard data flow.

🗣 Interview line:
“E2E tests help verify real user scenarios from request to response.”

✅ 4. Load/Performance Testing
🔍 What: Test how the API performs under stress or high traffic.
🧪 Goal: Make sure it stays fast and doesn’t crash.

📦 Tools: Apache JMeter, k6, Azure Load Testing

Example: Simulate 1000 users hitting /api/orders at once.

🗣 Interview line:
“I use load testing to measure how the API performs under stress.”

✅ 5. Security Testing
🔍 What: Test for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, CSRF, or broken authentication.
🧪 Goal: Keep the API secure.

📦 Tools: OWASP ZAP, Postman, or manual checks

Example: Try injecting scripts into form fields to test XSS.

🗣 Interview line:
“Security testing helps ensure the API is protected from common attacks.”

✅ 6. Smoke Testing
🔍 What: Basic check to ensure major functions work after deployment.
🧪 Goal: Quick pass/fail check of core functionality.

Example: After deploying, hit /health and /api/home to confirm it's alive.

🗣 Interview line:
“I run smoke tests after deployment to verify basic API health and readiness.”



54. How would you implement unit testing for an ASP.NET Core Web API controller?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Answer Summary:
“I write unit tests for controllers by mocking the service layer using Moq. Then I test only the controller's behavior — like whether it returns OK, NotFound, etc. I use xUnit for writing test cases and test methods like Get or Post with various inputs and mocked responses.”

🔁 Memory Trick:
Arrange → Act → Assert (AAA pattern)
(Set up mock → Call controller → Check result)



55. Explain the concept of integration testing and how you would implement it for a Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Answer Summary:
“Integration testing in ASP.NET Core Web API verifies the full request-response pipeline by calling real API endpoints. I use WebApplicationFactory to spin up the application and make real HTTP calls using HttpClient. This tests how controllers, services, and the database work together.”

🔁 Memory Trick:
“Unit = isolated. Integration = connected.”
(Think of integration as testing the full API behavior, not just one method.)

🔍 What Is Integration Testing?
Integration testing checks if multiple parts of your application work together correctly – like controllers, services, database, and middleware.

Unlike unit tests (which test only one piece in isolation), integration tests run the whole pipeline.

🎯 Goal:
Make real HTTP calls to your Web API endpoints

Use a test server and database

Verify the entire flow from request to response.





56. How would you perform load testing and stress testing for an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Answer Summary:
“I use tools like JMeter or k6 to simulate traffic for my ASP.NET Core Web API. For load testing, I simulate expected traffic levels like 100 users. For stress testing, I gradually increase users until the API slows down or crashes. I monitor response times, error rates, and resource usage to find performance bottlenecks.”

🎯 Memory Tip:
Load = Normal Pressure
Stress = Break It!

| Type           | What It Checks                          | Purpose                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Load Testing**  | Handles expected traffic                | Can it handle 100 users at once? |
| **Stress Testing** | Push beyond normal limits (until it breaks) | Where is the breaking point?     |


Deployment and Monitoring:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Explain the different deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling) and when to use them for an ASP.NET Core Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Quick Recap for Interview:
“In blue-green deployment, I have two identical environments and switch traffic once the new version is ready. With canary deployment, I roll out the update to a small group of users first and gradually expand. For rolling deployment, I update servers one at a time, ensuring no downtime for users.”

🧠 Memory Trick:
Blue-Green: Two identical environments, switch when green is ready.

Canary: Small subset first, then increase.

Rolling: Incremental, one server at a time.

🎯 Deployment Strategies
✅ 1. Blue-Green Deployment
What:
In blue-green deployment, you have two identical environments:

Blue: Current production environment

Green: New version with updates

How it works:

The Green environment is updated and tested.

Once it’s ready, traffic is switched from Blue to Green (i.e., the new version is now live).

If there’s an issue, traffic can quickly be switched back to Blue.

Use Case:

When you need to ensure minimal downtime and easy rollback.

Example:

You deploy a new version of your API in the Green environment, and once confirmed, you route all traffic to Green.

🗣 Interview Line:
“In blue-green deployment, we run two identical environments — blue for production and green for the new version. When green is ready, we switch traffic. This ensures zero downtime and easy rollback.”

✅ 2. Canary Deployment
What:
Canary deployment rolls out the new version to a small subset of users first. Gradually, more traffic is sent to the new version if everything goes well.

How it works:

A small portion of the traffic is routed to the new version (the “canary”).

If the canary version is stable, more traffic is shifted over time.

If issues arise, the canary version can be rolled back without affecting the majority of users.

Use Case:

When you want to test the new version with real users before fully committing.

Example:

You deploy your Web API to 5% of users initially. If it performs well, 10% of users are moved to the new version, and so on.

🗣 Interview Line:
“Canary deployment starts with a small subset of users. Gradually, the new version is rolled out to everyone if no issues arise. It’s a great way to minimize risk when releasing new versions.”

✅ 3. Rolling Deployment
What:
In a rolling deployment, the new version is gradually rolled out to all servers one at a time.

How it works:

Traffic is gradually shifted from the old version to the new one across all servers or instances.

At each step, the application is deployed to a new set of servers without taking down the entire service.

Users experience minimal to no downtime as the deployment happens incrementally.

Use Case:

When you want to update multiple servers in sequence with minimal disruption.

Example:

If you have 5 servers, the new version is deployed to one server at a time, ensuring some servers always run the old version until all servers are updated.

🗣 Interview Line:
“With rolling deployment, I deploy the new version one server at a time, ensuring users still have access to the service. It’s good for scenarios where we need to update multiple servers without downtime.”




57. How would you implement health checks and monitoring for an ASP.NET Core Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Line:
“For monitoring, I use Application Insights for tracking performance, failures, and logging. It gives deep insights into request-response times and exceptions. I also use basic logging to capture important events like API calls and errors. This helps us keep an eye on the health and performance of the API in real-time.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
Health Check = Is it working?
Monitoring = How is it performing?

✅ What Are Health Checks?
Health checks allow you to monitor the health of your API to ensure that it’s working as expected. They provide an endpoint that you can check to verify if the application is up and running.

Why use them?

Helps identify if your application is healthy and responsive.

Can be used for auto-scaling and load balancers to route traffic away from unhealthy instances.

✅ Step 1: Adding Health Checks to Your Web API
You can add health checks in your Startup.cs or Program.cs file, depending on the .NET version.

In Program.cs (for .NET 6 and above):

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add health checks services
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();

// Add other services
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();

// Map health check endpoint
app.MapHealthChecks("/health");

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
✅ What Will Happen?
When you navigate to https://yourdomain.com/health, it will check the basic health of your API.

If it's not healthy (e.g., database down), it will return an HTTP status like 503 Service Unavailable.

🧠 Interview Line:
“Health checks are built into ASP.NET Core, and I implement them by adding the AddHealthChecks() method in Program.cs or Startup.cs.
I can check specific dependencies like the database or external APIs by adding custom checks. The /health endpoint will indicate if the application is healthy or not.”




58. What are the benefits of containerizing an ASP.NET Core Web API, and how would you deploy it to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Line:
“Containerizing an ASP.NET Core Web API ensures portability and consistency across environments. I use Docker to package the application into a container, and Kubernetes to deploy and manage it at scale. Kubernetes handles deployment, scaling, and availability by running multiple instances (pods) and automatically managing traffic through services.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
Containerization = Portability & Consistency
Kubernetes = Manage, Scale, Deploy
(Think: Docker = package, Kubernetes = orchestrate.)

🎯 What is Containerization?
Containerization is the process of packaging an application along with all its dependencies into a container. This container is self-contained and runs consistently on any environment that supports containers, such as development, testing, staging, or production.

For an ASP.NET Core Web API, this means we package everything the application needs (e.g., .NET runtime, libraries) into a container image, ensuring it runs the same everywhere, whether on your machine or in the cloud.

✅ Benefits of Containerizing an ASP.NET Core Web API:
Consistency Across Environments:

"It works on my machine!" is a thing of the past. With containers, your application runs the same in development, testing, and production.

Isolation and Security:

Containers isolate your app from the host system, reducing the risk of conflicts and security issues.

Scalability:

Containers are lightweight, allowing you to scale your API more easily by adding or removing container instances.

Simplified Deployment:

With containers, the deployment process becomes simpler and more predictable, especially in cloud environments or with CI/CD pipelines.

Resource Efficiency:

Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than virtual machines, using fewer resources.

Portability:

You can easily move containers between environments (e.g., from your local machine to Azure or AWS) without worrying about compatibility.






59. Explain the concept of observability (logging, metrics, tracing) and how you would implement it in an ASP.NET Core Web API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Line:
“In an ASP.NET Core Web API, observability includes three key pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. Logging helps us track events, like errors and info, to understand what’s happening in the app. Metrics allow us to monitor the performance of the app, like request counts and response times. Tracing helps us track the journey of a request through the system. I implement these by using built-in logging frameworks, integrating Application Insights for tracing, and using Prometheus for gathering performance metrics.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
Logging = Track Events
Metrics = Measure Performance
Tracing = Track Requests


🎯 What is Observability?
Observability refers to how well we can understand what’s happening inside our system by collecting data. It’s like having a dashboard that shows you all the important info, like the system’s health, performance, and any errors.

✅ The Three Pillars of Observability
Logging:

Logging records important events in your application, like errors, warnings, or informational messages.

It’s like a diary for your app, helping you trace what happened at a particular time.

Metrics:

Metrics provide quantitative data about how the system is performing, such as response times, request counts, or CPU usage.

They give you insights into the health of the system over time.

Tracing:

Tracing helps track the journey of a request as it moves through different services or components, showing you how long each part takes.

It helps you identify bottlenecks or slowdowns in the flow of the application.

60. How to handle JSON Patch requests in an ASP.NET Core web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Line:
“To handle JSON Patch requests in an ASP.NET Core Web API, I use the built-in JsonPatchDocument<T> class to apply partial updates to a resource. The client sends only the changes, and I apply those changes using the ApplyTo method. I validate the model state afterward to ensure the patch was applied successfully. This minimizes the data transferred, especially for large objects.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
PATCH = Modify Part of an Object
JSON Patch = Apply Changes to Specific Fields
(Think of it like "updating just the recipe's salt" in a dish, not the whole meal.)

🎯 What is JSON Patch?
JSON Patch is a format defined by RFC 6902 to apply partial modifications to a JSON document. The client sends a patch document with an array of operations that specify how to modify the resource. These operations can be:

add: Adds a value to a specific location.

remove: Removes a value from a specific location.

replace: Replaces the value at a specific location.

move: Moves a value from one location to another.

copy: Copies a value from one location to another.

test: Checks if a value at a specific location is as expected.

✅ How to Handle JSON Patch Requests in an ASP.NET Core Web API?
ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for JSON Patch through the Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch package. This makes it easy to process PATCH requests in your Web API.




61. How will you choose from a class library project or Web API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Line:
“If my goal is to create reusable logic that will be used across different applications (e.g., business rules, data access), I would choose a class library project. However, if I need to expose my application or data over HTTP for clients to interact with, like mobile apps or other services, I would choose a Web API project. Often, both can be used together: the Web API would expose HTTP endpoints and call the class library for business logic.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
Class Library = Reusable code, no HTTP
Web API = Exposes data or services over HTTP

🎯 Class Library vs Web API: What's the Difference?
1️⃣ Class Library Project
A class library is a project type where you write reusable code (like services, business logic, or utility functions) that can be used by other applications or projects.

It does not expose endpoints or run a web server. Instead, it contains classes or methods that are called from other applications (like a Web API, desktop application, etc.).

Use Cases for Class Library:
Business Logic: You have reusable code that performs business rules, calculations, or data transformations that need to be shared across multiple applications.

Utilities: You need shared utilities like logging, validation, or encryption that multiple applications can use.

Data Access: You want to encapsulate database operations or interact with external services from different parts of your system.

2️⃣ Web API Project
A Web API is a project where you expose HTTP endpoints that clients can consume (typically via REST).

It's designed to allow other systems or front-end applications to interact with your data and services over the network using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Use Cases for Web API:
Client-Server Communication: You want to expose data or business operations for other systems (like web apps, mobile apps, or external services) to consume.

Microservices: You are building a system that needs to communicate with other microservices via HTTP (e.g., for a distributed application).

Interoperability: You want your system to interact with a variety of different clients that can make HTTP requests, such as third-party services or different platforms.




62. What is OpenApi?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Interview Line:
“OpenAPI is a specification for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a standard way to define API endpoints, request/response formats, and status codes. In ASP.NET Core, we use tools like Swashbuckle to generate Swagger documentation automatically, making it easier for developers to test and interact with the API. It's helpful because it standardizes the way APIs are described and can generate both client code and documentation from the OpenAPI specification.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
OpenAPI = Structured API definition
Swagger = Tool for displaying and testing OpenAPI docs
(Think of OpenAPI as the blueprint for your house, and Swagger as the interactive tour guide.)

🎯 Key Concepts:
1. What Does OpenAPI Do?
OpenAPI allows you to define your API in a structured way, typically in a JSON or YAML format.

It serves as a contract between the API provider (server) and the consumer (client). It provides details like:

Available endpoints (e.g., /api/products or /api/users/{id}).

Supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

Expected request parameters (e.g., query parameters, headers, body data).

Response format and status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request).

2. Why Use OpenAPI?
Standardization: It gives a clear and consistent structure for your API, which helps everyone involved, whether it's the developer, tester, or consumer.

Documentation: OpenAPI makes it easier to document the API. Tools like Swagger can automatically generate interactive API documentation based on the OpenAPI specification.

Client & Server Stubs: You can generate client code (like in JavaScript, Java, C#) and server stubs (for building API endpoints) from the OpenAPI specification. This helps speed up development.

3. Swagger and OpenAPI
Swagger is a set of tools for working with OpenAPI. Swagger UI is a tool that can display your OpenAPI documentation in an interactive and easy-to-understand way, allowing developers to test API endpoints directly from the browser.

Swagger Codegen and Swagger Editor are also popular tools that work with OpenAPI to generate server-side code, client libraries, or even interactive API documentation.




63. What is Swagger?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Interview Line:
“Swagger is a framework that makes it easier to document and test RESTful APIs. It uses the OpenAPI specification to automatically generate interactive API documentation. With Swagger UI, developers can view and test their API endpoints directly in the browser. In ASP.NET Core, you can easily integrate Swagger using the Swashbuckle library, which generates the documentation and provides a web interface to explore and test the API.”

🎯 Memory Trick:
Swagger = Interactive API docs
Swagger UI = Browser tool for testing API endpoints

🎯 Key Concepts of Swagger:
Interactive API Documentation:

Swagger allows you to generate dynamic, interactive API documentation that lets developers explore and test your API endpoints directly from their browsers.

This makes it easier for developers to understand how your API works and test different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE without having to write any additional code or tools.

Auto-Generated Documentation:

Once you define your API using the OpenAPI specification, Swagger automatically generates the documentation. You don't have to manually write out the details for each endpoint or parameter. Swagger does that for you.

API Testing:

Swagger’s UI lets you test API endpoints directly from the documentation interface. You can see what the response will look like, and you can even send requests to the API without needing a separate tool (like Postman).




64. How will you generate web API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Interview Line:
"To generate API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI in an ASP.NET Core Web API, I add the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore NuGet package, then configure it in Startup.cs by registering the Swagger service in ConfigureServices() and enabling Swagger middleware in Configure(). This automatically generates the OpenAPI specification and provides Swagger UI, allowing interactive documentation and testing of API endpoints right from the browser."

🎯 Memory Trick:
Swashbuckle = The tool that generates Swagger docs
Swagger UI = The interactive documentation for testing APIs



65. How will you Diff LINQ and Lamda Function with Examples?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Feature             | LINQ (Query Syntax)                               | Lambda (Method Syntax)                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Style               | SQL-like                                          | Functional/arrow-style                         |
| Readability         | Easier for complex queries                        | More concise for short queries                  |
| Used with           | `from`, `where`, `select`, `orderby`, etc.        | `Where()`, `Select()`, `OrderBy()`, etc.        |
| Behind the scenes   | Compiles to Lambda expressions                    | Directly uses Lambda expressions                |

🧠 Final Tip for Interview:
You can say:

“I’m comfortable using both LINQ and Lambda. LINQ is more readable for complex queries like joins, while Lambda is cleaner and preferred for quick filtering and mapping. Internally, even LINQ compiles to Lambda.”
